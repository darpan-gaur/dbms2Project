\section*{Introduction}
The Job Portal system serves as a platform that bridges job seekers and employers. We have developed a web-based application for job seekers and employers to connect with each other. Job seekers can create profiles, browse job listings, apply for positions, and track the status of their applications. Employers can post job openings, review applications, and manage candidate information efficiently. The system also provides notifications to keep users informed about relevant events.

\section*{Database Design}
ER Diagram: Figure \ref{fig:ER Diagram} shows the ER Diagram of the database.
The following tables are present in the database:

\end{itemize}
